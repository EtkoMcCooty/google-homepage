This project is my version of Google's homepage. 

This was the first project I have done by myself and I have learnt a lot such as:

- How to create grids and align elements using CSS grid 
- How to create flex containers and align elements using flexbox
- How to create a navbar
- The basic git workflow
- How to add material icons to my page

I'm still having trouble with:

- Aligning elements correctly all the time in both CSS grid and flexbox

- Offsetting icon positions so that they are level with text

Overall though, I have had fun completing this project as it made me stretch myself and I feel like a better developer because of it.
